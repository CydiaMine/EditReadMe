CydiaMine is set to become the default package manager for the Dopamine jailbreak tool. Currently, it is exclusively available for Dopamine. Support for other jailbreak tools is not yet available.

## Installing CydiaMine

We will be releasing the tutorial for CydiaMine (Cydia for Dopamine) as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates. 

* . CydiaMine has released on June 4th . But Sunst⭐️r_A16 has released an incompleted version of CydiaMine. 

## Supported versions

CydiaMine is only compatible with Dopamine-supported iOS and iPadOS versions. Compatibility with the latest releases and other versions is not available now.

## Release Date 

No ETA - Maybe next week

## Why CydiaMine?

Cydia became outdated after Checkra1n, and Sileo lacks many tweaks, leaving a gap in the market. CydiaMine aims to fill this gap by replacing both.
