CydiaMine is set to become the default package manager for the Dopamine jailbreak tool. Currently, it is exclusively available for Dopamine. Support for other jailbreak tools is not yet available.

## Installing CydiaMine

We will be releasing the tutorial for CydiaMine (Cydia for Dopamine) as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates. 
 

## Supported versions

CydiaMine is only compatible with Dopamine-supported iOS and iPadOS versions. Compatibility with the latest releases and other versions is not available now.

## Release Date 

Sunst⭐️r_A16 (@Sunstar_16) tweeted on June 4 that CYDIAMINE IS OUT (incomplete), describing it as more of a demo rather than a final version because it reads from the rootfull path /etc/ instead of /var/jb/etc/apt/preferences.d/. Currently, users can only search for tweaks and view their already installed tweaks.

## Why CydiaMine?

Cydia became outdated after Checkra1n, and Sileo lacks many tweaks, leaving a gap in the market. CydiaMine aims to fill this gap by replacing both.
